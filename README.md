# WHO-Project:

This was project one of my end-of-module assignment for Predictive Modelling. Our team Analytica was asked to predict life expectancies across the globe using data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). The submission is multiple Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files containing the stages of project development; including EDA, Feature Engineering, Modelling and Testing, and an individual file containing a single function to run our models.

Another key consideration with this project was ethical considerations. As data practitioners, we must have carefully considered which features to use in each model, balancing the need for accurate predictions with the importance of data privacy.

These notebooks are annotated and code-commented for easy access and interpretation.

## Key Outcomes:

- Build two continuous predictive models (linear regression)
   - One best performing, one minimalistic
- Deploy both into an interactive function
- Ethical considerations and data practices
